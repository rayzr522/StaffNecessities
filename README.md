# StaffNecessities

> Various utilities for controlling chat. An essential plugin for any server! Fully configurable sounds, permissions and messages.

This plugin was a request by _Kelzark_ for the **_Hydrus_** network.

## Installation

Just go and grab the latest JAR files off of the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/StaffNecessities/releases)!

## Configuring

All permissions, messages and command sounds are configurable. A list of valid sounds to be used is generated when the plugin is first run, due to the fact that the `Sound` enum values are different in 1.8 and below versus 1.9+.
